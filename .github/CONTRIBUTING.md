# Thank you for your interest in contributing to PL/Java!

First, a quick review of resources you might want to refer to:

PL/Java has a an [Issue Tracker], a [Wiki], a [Mailing List], and of course
an on-line [documentation site].

PL/Java has had a Contribution Guide for a long time, but over in the Wiki
where GitHub did not find it for automatic linking. The file you are now
reading was created so GitHub can find it, and the Conbtribution Guide is
still over in the Wiki where it's always been:

[Contribution Guide]

Please take a look there, and thank you again for your interest in contributing!
